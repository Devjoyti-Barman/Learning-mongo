1. To clear terminal or command port use ctrl+l(control plus l).
2. To exit from mongodb use ctrl+c (control plus c).
3. To show database:
    method:  show dbs
           At first it will show
           admin  0.000GB
           config 0.000GB
           local  0.000GB
    Note: do not write method:
4. To create database or to use existing one:
   method: use students (database_name is students)
   i. if you have pre existing database it will use that database.
   ii. if you don't have database with that name, it will create  a database with that name and use it.
       But you do "show dbs" it will not show that database, untill and unless you save some data or add some collection to database.
       So, make sure you remember that.
    Note: make sure you use some database.
5. How mongodb store => There is some database and inside of it,it has some collection.
   So, you have to name each collection.
   And you store data in that collection.
6. To add one data into collection (here collection_name is studentData):
    method: db.studentData.insertOne(
      {
	     "name": "Hitesh",
	     "email": "hitesh@hiteshchoudhary.com",
	     "contact": "9999999999",
	     "courseCount": 4,
	     "isVerified": true
      }
    )

    Note: remember that,
    I have a database and it's name is students.
    And inside of students database it has some collection.
    And one collection name is studentData.
    studentData hold some data like above
7. To fetch some data or to show data:
   method: db.studentData.find()
     It will give you big nasty object.
     To show data in pretty way use
   method: db.studentData.find().pretty()
