1. To insert Many Data 
   
   method: db.studentData.insert( [ {data},{data} ] )
   here studentData is collection name

2. To get Many Data
    
    If you have lots of data and you use

    method:  db.studentData.find()
            or
    method:  db.studentData.find().pretty()

    it will show you enter it to print more,
    But in pactical we do not use db.studentData.find() or db.studentData.find().pretty(),
    these are for commant shell or terminal

    To get Data we use

    method: db.studentData.find().forEach( (student) => {printjson(student)})

    Note: Here forEach is loop and (student) => {printjson(student)} is arrow function which exist in javascript

    If you don't know what's happening

    i.   db.studentData.find()  will find the data
    ii.  forEach is a loop , once finding the data is complete in studentData collection,
         forEach loop will go to data one by one
    iii. And To grap data we are using arrow function ()=>{}
         here student is itrator which hold data
         And to print the data in json(javascript) type we are using printjson(student)
