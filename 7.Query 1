To Query We have Two Method

i. db.studentData.find( {condition} )
   
   Suppose I need to find data which has courseCount=4

   method: db.studentData.find( {courseCount:4} )
   Note: This will Give you all the data which has courseCount=4


ii. db.studentData.find( {condition or where} ,{value} )
   
   Note: {condition or where} is a option it means that, in which-data, option is match
   
   Suppose, I need to find only email:

    method:    db.studentData.find( {},{email:1} )
    1.
      i.Here {} means that I don't care from which-data, this email-data comes from.
      
      ii. Here email:1 means show email value and email:0 means don't show this value
      
      iii. By deafult It will show you  the _id but if we don't want to show _id
          
          method: db.studentData.find( {},{email:1,_id:0} )
    2.  Suppose, I need to find the email and name in which courseCount =4 and we don't want _id
        
        method: db.studentData.find( {courseCount4},{name:1,email:1,_id:0} )

iii.   Suppose we want data in array like
      
       method: db.studentData.find( {courseCount4},{name:1,email:1,_id:0} ).toArray()
