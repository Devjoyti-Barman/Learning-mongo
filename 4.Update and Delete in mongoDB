To delete some data in collection
   we need To find a key which will differenciate that data from rest of data from collection.

1. To delete one data:
   method: db.studentData.deleteOne({"email":"abc@gmail.com"})
   Here email is key

   Suppose you have somedata in studentData collection
[
{
	"name": "Hitesh",
	"email": "hitesh@hiteshchoudhary.com",
	"contact": "9999999999",
	"courseCount": 4,
	"isVerified": true
},
{
	"name": "Mark",
	"email": "mark@example.com",
	"contact": "9999999888",
	"courseCount": 2,
	"isVerified": false
}
]
if you use
      db.studentData.deleteOne({"email":"mark@example.com"})
      after that your data will look like
      Here email is key
[
{
	"name": "Hitesh",
	"email": "hitesh@hiteshchoudhary.com",
	"contact": "9999999999",
	"courseCount": 4,
	"isVerified": true
}
]
Note: you want to delete via courseCount:2 and you have courseCount:2 on multiple data it will only delete first one
2. To deleteMany
   First, we need to find key
   method: db.studentData.deleteMany({"courseCount":2})
   Here courseCount is key
Note: if we do 
        method: db.studentData.deleteMany({})
        it will delete every data from collection



3.  Update operetion
    i.To add a entry into a particular data,
        First  we need to identify that particular data via key
        Here key is courseCount  
        db.studentData.updateOne({"courseCount": 4}, {$set: {fbloggedIn:"yes"}})
    Note: If you have courseCount:4 on multiple data it will insert the entry fbloggedIn:"yes" to only first-one
    
    ii.To add a entry into a Many data
        First  we need to identify that particular data via key
        Here key is courseCount  
        db.studentData.updateMany({"courseCount": 4}, {$set: {fbloggedIn:"yes"}})
