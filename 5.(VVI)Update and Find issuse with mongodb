   Find issuse

1.To find all data which has entry courseCount=4
  db.studentData.find({"courseCount":4}).pretty()
  Note: We can't use pretty() to findOne({condition}) .  findOne({"courseCount":4}).pretty() it will give you error.
        We can only use pretty()  on find()

2. if courseCount=4 is present on multiple data and if we use 
     db.studentData.findOne({"courseCount":4})
     it will give first data which match to courseCount 4

3. if we want courseCount greater than 4
   method:  db.studentData.find({courseCount: {$gt:1} }).pretty()
   here 'gt' means greater than
   here 'lt' means less than

   Update issuse
   Note: do not never ever use update. use updateOne and  updateMany.
   because if you use update it can mess your database.
